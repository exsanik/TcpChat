Develop an application that sends messages and images downloaded from files over a local network using the TCP / IP protocol to several users who have launched another application to view messages. When a text message or image file is received, it should be displayed in the message receiving application on the screen in specially designated places. When you receive a graphic file, it should be scaled using GDI+ tools to a size of 320x240 pixels, and a 10-pixel wide gradient frame should be drawn around the image. The image should always be displayed in an area of 320x240 pixels. When you first launch the message sender, the icon should be placed in the Windows Tray and a dialog should open when you press Ctrl + H to select the image file to send, even if the application is minimized in the Windows Tray. When you press Ctrl + R, you need to get a list of all installed applications in the registry and send this information as a message to any other applications that display messages.
