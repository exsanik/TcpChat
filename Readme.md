This application allows users to send messages and images over a local network using the TCP/IP protocol. It also has the capability to send these messages and images to multiple recipients who can view them on a separate application. When a message or image is received, it is displayed on the screen of the message receiving application in designated areas. The application automatically scales graphic files to a size of 320x240 pixels and draws a 10-pixel wide gradient frame around the received image to enhance its visual appeal. All images are displayed within a fixed area of 320x240 pixels, regardless of their original size. The application's icon is placed in the Windows Tray for easy access and to minimize screen clutter. Keyboard shortcuts are also available for user convenience, including pressing Ctrl+H to open a dialog for selecting an image file to send and pressing Ctrl+R to retrieve a list of installed applications from the registry and send it as a message to other applications displaying messages.
